Now that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the labyrinth of hallways
and office furniture that makes up this part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be
a graphic design department; the walls are covered in specifications for
triangles.

Or are they?

The design document gives the side lengths of each triangle it describes,
but... `5 10 25`? Some of these aren't triangles. You can't help but mark the
impossible ones.

In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the
remaining side. For example, the "triangle" given above is impossible,
because `5 + 10` is not larger than `25`.

In your puzzle input, **how many** of the listed triangles are **possible**?

Your puzzle answer was `869`.

## [Part Two](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/3#part2)

> [TypeScript](/solutions/typescript/2016/03/part_two.ts)

Now that you've helpfully marked up their design documents, it occurs to you
that triangles are specified in groups of three **vertically**. Each set of
three numbers in a column specifies a triangle. Rows are unrelated.

For example, given the following specification, numbers with the same
hundreds digit would be part of the same triangle:

```sh
101 301 501
102 302 502
103 303 503
201 401 601
202 402 602
203 403 603
```

In your puzzle input, and instead reading by columns, **how many** of the
listed triangles are **possible**?

Your puzzle answer was `1544`.
