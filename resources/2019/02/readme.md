On the way to your
[gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) around the
Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a
"[1202 program alarm](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html#1023832)".
On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: "Don't
worry, that's perfectly norma--" The ship computer
[bursts into flames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire).

You notify the Elves that the computer's
[magic smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke) seems to have
escaped. "That computer ran **Intcode** programs like the gravity assist
program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to
build a new Intcode computer!"

An Intcode program is a list of
[integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) separated by commas (like
`1,0,0,3,99`). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called
position `0`). Here, you will find an **opcode** - either `1`, `2`, or `99`.
The opcode indicates what to do; for example, `99` means that the program is
finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means
something went wrong.

Opcode `1` **adds** together numbers read from two positions and stores the
result in a third position. The three integers **immediately after** the
opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the
**positions** from which you should read the input values, and the third
indicates the **position** at which the output should be stored.

For example, if your Intcode computer encounters `1,10,20,30`, it should read
the values at positions `10` and `20`, add those values, and then overwrite
the value at position `30` with their sum.

Opcode `2` works exactly like opcode `1`, except it **multiplies** the two
inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode
indicate **where** the inputs and outputs are, not their values.

Once you're done processing an opcode, **move to the next one** by stepping
forward `4` positions.

For example, suppose you have the following program:

`1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50`
For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple
lines:

`1,9,10,3, 2,3,11,0, 99, 30,40,50`
The first four integers, `1,9,10,3`, are at positions `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`.
Together, they represent the first opcode (`1`, addition), the positions of
the two inputs (`9` and `10`), and the position of the output (`3`). To
handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions:
position `9` contains `30`, and position `10` contains `40`. **Add** these
numbers together to get `70`. Then, store this value at the output position;
here, the output position (`3`) is **at** position `3`, so it overwrites
itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:

`1,9,10,70, 2,3,11,0, 99, 30,40,50`
Step forward `4` positions to reach the next opcode, `2`. This opcode works
just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at
positions `3` and `11`; these positions contain `70` and `50` respectively.
Multiplying these produces `3500`; this is stored at position `0`:

`3500,9,10,70, 2,3,11,0, 99, 30,40,50`
Stepping forward `4` more positions arrives at opcode `99`, halting the program.

Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:

- `1,0,0,0,99` becomes `2,0,0,0,99` (`1 + 1 = 2`).
- `2,3,0,3,99` becomes `2,3,0,6,99` (`3 * 2 = 6`).
- `2,4,4,5,99,0` becomes `2,4,4,5,99,9801` (`99 * 99 = 9801`).
- `1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99` becomes `30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99`.

Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, **before running the**
**program**, replace position `1` with the value `12` and replace position `2`
with the value `2`. **What value is left at position `0`** after the program
halts?

Your puzzle answer was `3101844`.

"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! **Keep it nearby**
during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers
support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they
are as you need them."

"However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist
around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some
terminology for the parts you've already built."

Intcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the
initial state for the computer's **memory**. When you run an Intcode program,
make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position
in memory is called an **address** (for example, the first value in memory is
at "address 0").

Opcodes (like `1`, `2`, or `99`) mark the beginning of an **instruction**. The
values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's
**parameters**. For example, in the instruction `1,2,3,4`, `1` is the opcode;
`2`, `3`, and `4` are the parameters. The instruction `99` contains only an
opcode and has no parameters.

The address of the current instruction is called the **instruction pointer**;
it starts at `0`. After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer
increases by **the number of values in the instruction**; until you add more
instructions to the computer, this is always `4` (`1` opcode + `3` parameters)
for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the
instruction pointer by `1`, but it halts the program instead.)

"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the
gravity assist, you need to **determine what pair of inputs produces the**
**output `19690720`**."

The inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at
addresses `1` and `2`, just like before. In this program, the value placed in
address `1` is called the **noun**, and the value placed in address `2` is
called the **verb**. Each of the two input values will be between `0` and `99`,
inclusive.

Once the program has halted, its output is available at address `0`, also just
like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first **reset**
**the computer's memory to the values in the program** (your puzzle input) -
in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.

Find the input **noun** and **verb** that cause the program to produce the
output `19690720`. **What is `100 * noun + verb`?** (For example, if `noun=12`
and `verb=2`, the answer would be `1202`.)

Your puzzle answer was `8478`.
