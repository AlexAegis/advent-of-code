As you ponder the solitude of space and the ever-increasing three-hour
roundtrip for messages between you and Earth, you notice that the Space Mail
Indicator Light is blinking. To help keep you sane, the Elves have sent you a
care package.

It's a new game for the ship's
[arcade cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_cabinet)! Unfortunately,
the arcade is **all the way** on the other end of the ship. Surely, it won't be
hard to build your own - the care package even comes with schematics.

The arcade cabinet runs [Intcode](../09) software like the game the Elves sent
(your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square
**tiles** on a grid. The software draws tiles to the screen with output
instructions: every three output instructions specify the `x` position
(distance from the left), `y` position (distance from the top), and `tile id`.
The `tile id` is interpreted as follows:

- `0` is an **empty** tile. No game object appears in this tile.
- `1` is a **wall** tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.
- `2` is a **block** tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.
- `3` is a **horizontal paddle** tile. The paddle is indestructible.
- `4` is a **ball** tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.

For example, a sequence of output values like `1,2,3,6,5,4` would draw a
**horizontal paddle** tile (`1` tile from the left and `2` tiles from the top)
and a **ball** tile (`6` tiles from the left and `5` tiles from the top).

Start the game. **How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits?**

Your puzzle answer was `255`.

The game didn't run because you didn't put in any quarters. Unfortunately, you
did not bring any quarters. Memory address `0` represents the number of
quarters that have been inserted; set it to `2` to play for free.

The arcade cabinet has a [joystick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick)
that can move left and right. The software reads the position of the joystick
with input instructions:

- If the joystick is in the **neutral position**, provide `0`.
- If the joystick is **tilted to the left**, provide `-1`.
- If the joystick is **tilted to the right**, provide `1`.

The arcade cabinet also has a
[segment display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device#Segment_displays)
capable of showing a single number that represents the player's current score.
When three output instructions specify `X=-1, Y=0`, the third output
instruction is not a tile; the value instead specifies the new score to show
in the segment display. For example, a sequence of output values like
`-1,0,12345` would show `12345` as the player's current score.

Beat the game by breaking all the blocks. **What is your score after the last**
**block is broken?**

Your puzzle answer was `12338`.
