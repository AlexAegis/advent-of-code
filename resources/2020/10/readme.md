## [Part One](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10#part1) - [TypeScript](./typescript/part_one.ts)

Patched into the aircraft's data port, you discover weather forecasts of a
massive tropical storm. Before you can figure out whether it will impact your
vacation plans, however, your device suddenly turns off!

Its battery is dead.

You'll need to plug it in. There's only one problem: the charging outlet near
your seat produces the wrong number of **jolts**. Always prepared, you make a
list of all of the joltage adapters in your bag.

Each of your joltage adapters is rated for a specific **output joltage** (your
puzzle input). Any given adapter can take an input `1`, `2`, or `3` jolts
**lower** than its rating and still produce its rated output joltage.

In addition, your device has a built-in joltage adapter rated for
**`3` jolts higher** than the highest-rated adapter in your bag. (If your
adapter list were `3`, `9`, and `6`, your device's built-in adapter would be
rated for `12` jolts.)

Treat the charging outlet near your seat as having an effective joltage
rating of `0`.

Since you have some time to kill, you might as well test all of your adapters.
Wouldn't want to get to your resort and realize you can't even charge your
device!

If you **use every adapter in your bag** at once, what is the distribution of
joltage differences between the charging outlet, the adapters, and your
device?

For example, suppose that in your bag, you have adapters with the following
joltage ratings:

```sh
16
10
15
5
1
11
7
19
6
12
4
```

With these adapters, your device's built-in joltage adapter would be rated for
`19 + 3 = 22` jolts, 3 higher than the highest-rated adapter.

Because adapters can only connect to a source 1-3 jolts lower than its rating,
in order to use every adapter, you'd need to choose them like this:

- The charging outlet has an effective rating of `0` jolts, so the only
  adapters that could connect to it directly would need to have a joltage
  rating of `1`, `2`, or `3` jolts. Of these, only one you have is an adapter
  rated `1` jolt (difference - of **`1`**).
- From your `1`-jolt rated adapter, the only choice is your `4`-jolt rated
  adapter (difference of **`3`**).
- From the `4`-jolt rated adapter, the adapters rated `5`, `6`, or `7` are
  valid choices. However, in order to not skip any adapters, you have to pick
  the adapter rated `5` jolts (difference of **`1`**).
- Similarly, the next choices would need to be the adapter rated `6` and then
  the adapter rated `7` (with difference of **`1`** and **`1`**).
- The only adapter that works with the `7`-jolt rated adapter is the one rated
  `10` jolts (difference of **`3`**).
- From `10`, the choices are `11` or `12`; choose `11` (difference of **`1`**)
  and then `12` (difference of **`1`**).
- After `12`, only valid adapter has a rating of `15` (difference of **`3`**),
  then `16` (difference of **`1`**), then `19` (difference of **`3`**).
- Finally, your device's built-in adapter is always 3 higher than the highest
  adapter, so its rating is `22` jolts (always a difference of **`3`**).

In this example, when using every adapter, there are **`7`** differences of 1
jolt and **`5`** differences of 3 jolts.

Here is a larger example:

```sh
28
33
18
42
31
14
46
20
48
47
24
23
49
45
19
38
39
11
1
32
25
35
8
17
7
9
4
2
34
10
3
```

In this larger example, in a chain that uses all of the adapters, there are
**`22`** differences of 1 jolt and **`10`** differences of 3 jolts.

Find a chain that uses all of your adapters to connect the charging outlet to
your device's built-in adapter and count the joltage differences between the
charging outlet, the adapters, and your device. **What is the number of**
**1-jolt differences multiplied by the number of 3-jolt differences?**

Your puzzle answer was `2201`.

## [Part Two](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10#part2) - [TypeScript](./typescript/part_two.ts)

To completely determine whether you have enough adapters, you'll need to
figure out how many different ways they can be arranged. Every arrangement
needs to connect the charging outlet to your device. The previous rules about
when adapters can successfully connect still apply.

The first example above (the one that starts with `16`, `10`, `15`) supports
the following arrangements:

```sh
(0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
(0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
(0), 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
(0), 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
(0), 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
(0), 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
(0), 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
(0), 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
```

(The charging outlet and your device's built-in adapter are shown in
parentheses.) Given the adapters from the first example, the total number of
arrangements that connect the charging outlet to your device is **`8`**.

The second example above (the one that starts with `28`, `33`, `18`) has many
arrangements. Here are a few:

```sh
(0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, (52)

(0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 47, 49, (52)

(0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 48, 49, (52)

(0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 49, (52)

(0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 47, 48, 49, (52)

(0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
46, 48, 49, (52)

(0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
46, 49, (52)

(0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
47, 48, 49, (52)

(0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
47, 49, (52)

(0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
48, 49, (52)
```

In total, this set of adapters can connect the charging outlet to your device
in **`19208`** distinct arrangements.

You glance back down at your bag and try to remember why you brought so many
adapters; there must be **more than a trillion** valid ways to arrange them!
Surely, there must be an efficient way to count the arrangements.

**What is the total number of distinct ways you can arrange the adapters to**
**connect the charging outlet to your device?**

Your puzzle answer was `169255295254528`.
