# [Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5)

## [Part One](./typescript/part_one.ts)

Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

A **nice string** is one with all of the following properties:

- It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.
- It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (`dd`), or `aabbccdd` (`aa`, `bb`, `cc`, or `dd`).
- It does **not** contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.

For example:

- `ugknbfddgicrmopn` is nice because it has at least three vowels (`u...i...o...`), a double letter (`...dd...`), and none of the disallowed substrings.
- `aaa` is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
- `jchzalrnumimnmhp` is naughty because it has no double letter.
- `haegwjzuvuyypxyu` is naughty because it contains the string `xy`.
- `dvszwmarrgswjxmb` is naughty because it contains only one vowel.

How many strings are nice?

Your puzzle answer was `236`.

## [Part Two](./typescript/part_two.ts)

Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.

Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:

- It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like `xyxy` (`xy`) or `aabcdefgaa` (`aa`), but not like `aaa` (`aa`, but it overlaps).
- It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like `xyx`, `abcdefeghi` (`efe`), or even `aaa`.

For example:

- `qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb` is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (`qj`) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (`zxz`).
- `xxyxx` is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.
- `uurcxstgmygtbstg` is naughty because it has a pair (`tg`) but no repeat with a single letter between them.
- `ieodomkazucvgmuy` is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (`odo`), but no pair that appears twice.

How many strings are nice under these new rules?
