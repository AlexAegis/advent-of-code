You catch the airport shuttle and try to book a new flight to your vacation
island. Due to the storm, all direct flights have been cancelled, but a route
is available to get around the storm. You take it.

While you wait for your flight, you decide to check in with the Elves back at
the North Pole. They're playing a **memory game** and are ever so excited to
explain the rules!

In this game, the players take turns saying **numbers**. They begin by taking
turns reading from a list of **starting numbers** (your puzzle input). Then,
each turn consists of considering the **most recently spoken number**:

- If that was the **first** time the number has been spoken, the current
  player says **`0`**.
- Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces
  **how many turns apart** the number is from when it was previously spoken.

So, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking
aloud either **`0`** (if the last number is new) or an **age** (if the last
number is a repeat).

For example, suppose the starting numbers are `0,3,6`:

- **Turn 1**: The `1`st number spoken is a starting number, **`0`**.
- **Turn 2**: The `2`nd number spoken is a starting number, **`3`**.
- **Turn 3**: The `3`rd number spoken is a starting number, **`6`**.
- **Turn 4**: Now, consider the last number spoken, `6`. Since that was the
  first time the number had been spoken, the `4`th number spoken is **`0`**.
- **Turn 5**: Next, again consider the last number spoken, `0`. Since it
  **had** been spoken before, the next number to speak is the difference
  between the turn number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, `4`) and
  the turn number of the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn
  `1`). Thus, the `5`th number spoken is `4 - 1`, **`3`**.
- **Turn 6**: The last number spoken, `3` had also been spoken before, most
  recently on turns `5` and `2`. So, the `6`th number spoken is `5 - 2`,
  **`3`**.
- **Turn 7**: Since `3` was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns
  are `1` turn apart, the `7`th number spoken is **`1`**.
- **Turn 8**: Since `1` is new, the `8`th number spoken is **`0`**.
- **Turn 9**: `0` was last spoken on turns `8` and `4`, so the `9`th number
  spoken is the difference between them, **`4`**.
- **Turn 10**: `4` is new, so the `10`th number spoken is **`0`**.

(The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready,
whichever comes first.)

Their question for you is: what will be the **`2020`th** number spoken? In
the example above, the `2020`th number spoken will be `436`.

Here are a few more examples:

- Given the starting numbers `1,3,2`, the `2020`th number spoken is `1`.
- Given the starting numbers `2,1,3`, the `2020`th number spoken is `10`.
- Given the starting numbers `1,2,3`, the `2020`th number spoken is `27`.
- Given the starting numbers `2,3,1`, the `2020`th number spoken is `78`.
- Given the starting numbers `3,2,1`, the `2020`th number spoken is `438`.
- Given the starting numbers `3,1,2`, the `2020`th number spoken is `1836`.

Given your starting numbers, what will be the 2020th number spoken?

Your puzzle answer was `1015`.

Impressed, the Elves issue you a challenge: determine the `30000000`th number
spoken. For example, given the same starting numbers as above:

- Given `0,3,6`, the `30000000`th number spoken is `175594`.
- Given `1,3,2`, the `30000000`th number spoken is `2578`.
- Given `2,1,3`, the `30000000`th number spoken is `3544142`.
- Given `1,2,3`, the `30000000`th number spoken is `261214`.
- Given `2,3,1`, the `30000000`th number spoken is `6895259`.
- Given `3,2,1`, the `30000000`th number spoken is `18`.
- Given `3,1,2`, the `30000000`th number spoken is `362`.

Given your starting numbers, **what will be the `30000000`th number spoken?**

Your puzzle answer was `201`.
