# [Day 22: Crab Combat](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22)

## [Part One](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22#part1) - [TypeScript](./typescript/part_one.ts)

It only takes a few hours of sailing the ocean on a raft for boredom to sink
in. Fortunately, you brought a small deck of
[space cards](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22)! You'd like to play a game
of **Combat**, and there's even an opponent available: a small crab that
climbed aboard your raft before you left.

Fortunately, it doesn't take long to teach the crab the rules.

Before the game starts, split the cards so each player has their own deck
(your puzzle input). Then, the game consists of a series of **rounds**: both
players draw their top card, and the player with the higher-valued card wins
the round. The winner keeps both cards, placing them on the bottom of their
own deck so that the winner's card is above the other card. If this causes a
player to have all of the cards, they win, and the game ends.

For example, consider the following starting decks:

```rs
Player 1:
9
2
6
3
1

Player 2:
5
8
4
7
10
```

This arrangement means that player 1's deck contains 5 cards, with `9` on top
and `1` on the bottom; player 2's deck also contains 5 cards, with `5` on top
and `10` on the bottom.

The first round begins with both players drawing the top card of their decks:
`9` and `5`. Player 1 has the higher card, so both cards move to the bottom of
player 1's deck such that `9` is above `5`. In total, it takes 29 rounds
before a player has all of the cards:

```rs
-- Round 1 --
Player 1's deck: 9, 2, 6, 3, 1
Player 2's deck: 5, 8, 4, 7, 10
Player 1 plays: 9
Player 2 plays: 5
Player 1 wins the round!

-- Round 2 --
Player 1's deck: 2, 6, 3, 1, 9, 5
Player 2's deck: 8, 4, 7, 10
Player 1 plays: 2
Player 2 plays: 8
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 3 --
Player 1's deck: 6, 3, 1, 9, 5
Player 2's deck: 4, 7, 10, 8, 2
Player 1 plays: 6
Player 2 plays: 4
Player 1 wins the round!

-- Round 4 --
Player 1's deck: 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4
Player 2's deck: 7, 10, 8, 2
Player 1 plays: 3
Player 2 plays: 7
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 5 --
Player 1's deck: 1, 9, 5, 6, 4
Player 2's deck: 10, 8, 2, 7, 3
Player 1 plays: 1
Player 2 plays: 10
Player 2 wins the round!

...several more rounds pass...

-- Round 27 --
Player 1's deck: 5, 4, 1
Player 2's deck: 8, 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6
Player 1 plays: 5
Player 2 plays: 8
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 28 --
Player 1's deck: 4, 1
Player 2's deck: 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5
Player 1 plays: 4
Player 2 plays: 9
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 29 --
Player 1's deck: 1
Player 2's deck: 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4
Player 1 plays: 1
Player 2 plays: 7
Player 2 wins the round!

Player 1's deck:
Player 2's deck: 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 7, 1
```

Once the game ends, you can calculate the winning player's **score**. The
bottom card in their deck is worth the value of the card multiplied by 1, the
second-from-the-bottom card is worth the value of the card multiplied by 2,
and so on. With 10 cards, the top card is worth the value on the card
multiplied by 10. In this example, the winning player's score is:

```rs
   3 * 10
+  2 *  9
+ 10 *  8
+  6 *  7
+  8 *  6
+  5 *  5
+  9 *  4
+  4 *  3
+  7 *  2
+  1 *  1
= 306
```

So, once the game ends, the winning player's score is **`306`**.

Play the small crab in a game of Combat using the two decks you just dealt.
**What is the winning player's score?**

Your puzzle answer was `31455`.

## [Part Two](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22#part2) - [TypeScript](./typescript/part_two.ts)

You lost to the small crab! Fortunately, crabs aren't very good at recursion.
To defend your honor as a Raft Captain, you challenge the small crab to a game
of **Recursive Combat**.

Recursive Combat still starts by splitting the cards into two decks (you offer
to play with the same starting decks as before - it's only fair). Then, the
game consists of a series of **rounds** with a few changes:

- Before either player deals a card, if there was a previous round in this
  game that had exactly the same cards in the same order in the same players'
  decks, the **game** instantly ends in a win for player 1. Previous rounds
  from other games are not considered. (This prevents infinite games of
  Recursive Combat, which everyone agrees is a bad idea.)
- Otherwise, this round's cards must be in a new configuration; the players
  begin the round by each drawing the top card of their deck as normal.
- If both players have at least as many cards remaining in their deck as the
  value of the card they just drew, the winner of the round is determined by
  playing a new game of Recursive Combat (see below).
- Otherwise, at least one player must not have enough cards left in their deck
  to recurse; the winner of the round is the player with the higher-value
  card.

As in regular Combat, the winner of the round (even if they won the round by
winning a sub-game) takes the two cards dealt at the beginning of the round
and places them on the bottom of their own deck (again so that the winner's
card is above the other card). Note that the winner's card might be
**the lower-valued of the two cards** if they won the round due to winning a
sub-game. If collecting cards by winning the round causes a player to have all
of the cards, they win, and the game ends.

Here is an example of a small game that would loop forever without the
infinite game prevention rule:

```rs
Player 1:
43
19

Player 2:
2
29
14
```

During a round of Recursive Combat, if both players have at least as many
cards in their own decks as the number on the card they just dealt, the winner
of the round is determined by recursing into a sub-game of Recursive Combat.
(For example, if player 1 draws the `3` card, and player 2 draws the `7` card,
this would occur if player 1 has at least 3 cards left and player 2 has at
least 7 cards left, not counting the `3` and `7` cards that were drawn.)

To play a sub-game of Recursive Combat, each player creates a new deck by
making a **copy** of the next cards in their deck (the quantity of cards
copied is equal to the number on the card they drew to trigger the sub-game).
During this sub-game, the game that triggered it is on hold and completely
unaffected; no cards are removed from players' decks to form the sub-game.
(For example, if player 1 drew the `3` card, their deck in the sub-game would
be **copies** of the next three cards in their deck.)

Here is a complete example of gameplay, where `Game 1` is the primary game of
Recursive Combat:

After the game, the winning player's score is calculated from the cards they
have in their original deck using the same rules as regular Combat. In the
above game, the winning player's score is **`291`**.

Defend your honor as Raft Captain by playing the small crab in a game of
Recursive Combat using the same two decks as before.
**What is the winning player's score?**

Your puzzle answer was `32528`.
